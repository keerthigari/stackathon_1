            <div class="info">Diarrhea loose, watery and possibly more-frequent bowel movements — is a common problem. It may be present alone or be associated with other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or weight loss.<br>Luckily, diarrhea is usually
                short-lived, lasting no more than a few days. But when diarrhea lasts beyond a few days into weeks, it usually indicates that there's another problem — such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a more serious disorder, including persistent
                infection, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease.</div>

                <br><br><span class="lite"><u>Common Recipes:</u></span><br> During diarrhoea, ensure that you are on a suitable diet to overcome dehydration, as advised by your physician. Home remedies are just supplementary approaches.<br><br><br> Whey
                and buttermilk are considered effective remedies for diarrhoea. Whey is the liquid portion of curd while buttermilk is obtained by churning the curd after the fat has been removed. Take any one of them in small volumes at frequent intervals.
                Raw banana is an effective astringent and is recommended widely as a diet for treating diarrhoea. Cut one raw banana into three pieces and soften them in a pressure cooker using an adequate volume of water. Drain out the excess water.
                Separate the peel and mash the softened pulp well. In a skillet, roast a small volume of poppy seeds till they turn brown. Grind them to obtain a fine powder. Add this powder to banana mash together with a pinch of salt. This delicious
                and nutritious recipe checks diarrhoea through its astringent properties. The dried rind of a pomegranate is an invaluable remedy for diarrhoea. A fine powder of this rind, 1 gm twice a day, taken with buttermilk helps check the frequency
                of loose motions.</div>
