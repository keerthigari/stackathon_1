                <p>1.Lifestyle changes can bring a great difference to your wellbeing. No matter how small they may be, their routine practice can have an effect on resolving sleep deprivation naturally.</p>
                <p>2.Healthy living goes beyond the exteriors of physical health and involves better emotional stability and wellbeing. Healthy living is not only about physical health that caters to regular diet and physical activity; it’s also about your
                    social connections and the rapport you share with them.</p>

                <p>5.Counselling and cognitive therapy help in relieving anxiety and depression thus help in relieving insomnia.</p>
                <p>6.Another useful home remedy for insomnia is to avoid day sleeping, watching T.V before going to bed, maintaining peaceful sleep environment all are conducive to a good night’s sleep.</p>
                <p>The ayurvedic approach to insomnia is to re-establish balance throughout the body and restore the natural sleep-wake cycle. According to the teachings of Ayurveda, most of the chronic conditions, including insomnia, are triggered by a
                    build-up of impurities in the body. Poor diet, weak digestion, excessively busy lifestyle, and too much stress can generate toxins and impair our body’s ability to get rid of them. Accumulated toxins interfere with our biochemistry
                    and disturb our metabolism, including sleep functions.</p>
