            <div class="info"><br> Everyone suffers the occasional mild headache, but if you experience debilitating pain and/or abnormally frequent headaches, you probably want to find relief. There are countless causes of headaches, which differ for each person, so you’ll
                have to do some experimenting to figure out the cause of your pain. Fortunately, the vast majority of headaches are primary headaches, not the result of underlying medical conditions. The three most common types are cluster, tension-type,
                and migraine.<br>
                <b>typesof headache</b><br><br> Cluster headache:<br> A cluster headache affects a specific point of the head, often the eye, and is characterized by sharp, piercing pain.<br><br> Migraine :<br> Migraine and tension-type headaches are
                far more common.<br><br> Tension-type headache <br> “Tension“ headaches are now called “tension-type“ headaches because pain is not only caused by stress, but also poor posture, depression, and even sexual activity. In fact, recent studies
                have shown a connection between low serotonin levels and so-called “tension“ headaches.<br>
