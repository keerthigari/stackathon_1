            <div class="info">A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. It’s a sign of your body's natural fight against infection. For adults, a fever is when your temperature is higher than 100.4°F. For kids, a fever is when their temperature is higher than 100.4°F
                (measured rectally); 99.5°F (measured orally); or 99°F (measured under the arm). The average normal body temperature is 98.6° Fahrenheit (or 37° Celsius). When you or your child’s temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it’s a sign
                that the body is healthy and fighting infection. In most cases, that’s a good thing. But when a fever rises above 102°F it should be treated at home and, if necessary, by your healthcare provider if the fever doesn’t go down after a few
                days.

                Body temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher
                is generally considered to be a fever. However, body temperature fluctuates naturally throughout the day, especially with physical activity.<br><br> A low grade fever occurs when a person’s body temperature reaches 100–102°F
                (37.8 to 39°C). A high grade fever occurs when a person’s body temperature exceeds 104°F (40°C).<br><br> Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:<br><br> 1.Sweating
                <br> 2.Chills and shivering<br> 3.Headache

        <div class="Remedies">
            <div class="info sy">
                <span class="lite"><u>Drinking lots of fluids<br></u></span> During a fever, the body needs to use more water to compensate for its elevated temperature. This can lead to dehydration.<br> Drinking water or an electrolyte replacement drink
                can help rehydrate the body.<br>
                <span class="lite"><u>Resting<br></u></span> Fighting an infection takes a lot of energy. People should rest as much as possible to help the body recover.<br>
                <p class="heads">Taking a tepid bath</p><br> Many people consider taking a cold bath when they have a fever. However, doing so can cause shivering, which will increase body temperature even more.
                <br> Instead, people can take a lukewarm or tepid bath to help the body cool off. A bath can also help soothe tired muscles.<br><br>
                <p class="heads">Using over-the-counter medications</p><br> Medications are not usually necessary to treat a fever. However, some over-the-counter (OTC) medications can help reduce a fever and make a person feel more comfortable. <br>

                results.
