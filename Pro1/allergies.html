            <div class="info">Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance — such as pollen, bee venom or pet dander — or a food that doesn't cause a reaction in most people.<br><br> Your immune system produces substances known as antibodies. When
                you have allergies, your immune system makes antibodies that identify a particular allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. When you come into contact with the allergen, your immune system's reaction can inflame your skin, sinuses, airways
                or digestive system.<br><br> The severity of allergies varies from person to person and can range from minor irritation to anaphylaxis — a potentially life-threatening emergency. While most allergies can't be cured, treatments can help
                relieve your allergy symptoms.</div>

        <div class="Remedies">
            <div class="info"><span class="lite"><u>1. Cold compress</u></span><br> One of the fastest and easiest ways to stop the pain and itch of a rash is to apply cold. Whether you choose a cold compress, cool showers, or damp cloth, cold water can bring immediate
                relief and can help stop swelling, ease itching, and slow the progression of a rash.<br> Consider making or purchasing fabric bags stuffed with ice. They freeze well, and they can be heated for other uses.<br>

                <span class="lite">How to use it</span><br> Fill an ice bag or plastic bag with ice or dampen a cloth with cold water.<br> Place a cloth over your skin (never place ice directly on your skin).<br> Hold on your skin until itching or pain
                subsides.<br> Repeat as needed.<br> How it works<br> Cold limits blood flow to an inflamed area. When you apply ice or cold water to a rash, it can help reduce swelling and inflammation and can stop itching almost immediately. For rashes
                that cover more of the body or that affect an area that is difficult to cover with an ice pack, a cool bath or shower may provide relief.
                <br><br><span class="lite"><u>2. Oatmeal bath</u></span><br> Oats (avena sativa) have been used for centuriesTrusted Source to treat many skin conditions, from eczema to burns. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use
                of oatmeal in suspension (colloidal oatmeal) as a skin protectant in 2003. Today there are many over-the-counter skin products containing oatmeal. Colloidal oatmeal dissolved in a bath can relieve itchiness. Commercial brands of oatmeal
